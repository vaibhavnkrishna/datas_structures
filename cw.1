 rfind();      if thegiven substring is available in  then rfind will the writtens  from the right side.
if you want to convert lower case charcter to upper chasevthen we can go for upper function
if you want to convert upper case to the lower case charcter then we can go for lower function
if you want to convert upper case to lower caseand lower to upper then we can go for swap case()
if you want to replace old string to new string then it is called   replace
if you want to replace the string with other string is called replace
